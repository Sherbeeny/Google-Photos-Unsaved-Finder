### Added
- Created a Tampermonkey userscript `google-photos-unsaved-finder`.
- The script adds a "Start Google Photos Unsaved Finder" menu command.
- When clicked, the command opens a simple UI window with the text "Aha!" and a close button.
- Implemented a custom, manual TDD process to develop and test the script in a restrictive environment.
