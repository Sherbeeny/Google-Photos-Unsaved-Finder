# Agent Progress

**Task:** Implement GPTK API detection feature.
**Version:** `2025.09.02-0742`
**Status:** Complete

## Work Completed
- Researched the external Google-Photos-Toolkit userscript to determine its API signature.
- Updated the custom TDD framework to support testing with and without the mock GPTK API present.
- Wrote failing tests to check for conditional UI text based on API availability.
- Implemented the API detection logic and updated the UI to show the correct message.
- Verified the implementation with passing tests and a manual code review.
- Followed the full prework -> work -> postwork process for this change.
- This task is now complete and submitted. The userscript is now more intelligent.
