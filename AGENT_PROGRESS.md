    *   Create a new entry in `CHANGELOG.md` for this new version.
    *   Update `package.json` and the userscript file with the new version.
    *   Update this file (`AGENT_PROGRESS.md`) to reflect this new plan and version.

2.  **Postwork: Submit the Changes**
    *   Commit all the changes made during the prework step.
